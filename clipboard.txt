Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times through earlier prophets, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Muslims consider the Quran to be the verbatim word of God and the unaltered final revelation. Alongside the Quran, Muslims also believe in previous revelations, such as the Tawrat (the Torah), the Zabur (Psalms), and the Injeel (Gospel).
